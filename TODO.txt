Compare basic ArcGIS map with DARMC map on Performance tab of inspect element. (Speed, number of recalculations)
For a ~10 second performance test including reloading page + zooming in and out:
  - darmc average 38fps, test average 29 38fps
  - darmc min fpd 4.8, test 3.2 38fps
  - in Call Tree, JIT function and IDLE take most time for darmc (1.3 and 4.6 seconds)
  - in Call Tree, JIT function and IDLE take most time for test (1.7 and 1.2 seconds)
  - Waterfall records show different events for the same tests (???)
  - In memory snapshot, darmc is ~13 MB larger
  - ~13 MB difference mostly accounted for by domNode
  - Do not know how much of this is a result of the specific wifi connection and  browser


Figure out how to transfer existing files (html, css, js) onto example in this repository (and to actually have something visual show up)

get layers to show up in calcitemap.html (or put layers widget into DARMC replica.html)
